There are three demos in this project. The first two are 
just very simple, slimmed-down versions of INCHI_WEB_DEMO.
They were just a couple of experiments I did early on 
with modifying the inchi-web.c code myself. They are not 
particularly valuable, in that their application is rather
limited. 

But if you are interested in just some very simple
code that allows a page to create InChIs from MOL files, 
this is all you need.

See the docs/ folder for those. 

The cdk/ocl demo JavaScript is much more integrated, implementing
both the Chemical Development Kit and OpenChemLib in JavaScript 
for the first time, and using JNA-InChI for both Java
and JavaScript. That demo is hosted on chemapps.stolaf.edu, 
but its full zip file is here. Just unzip it and point your 
local web server at it.
